# CRE
The Causal Rule Ensemble Method

Two R code files are currently available (2021/05/10). 
1. causal_rulefit_functions.R contains the basic functions to run R codes. 
2. rcode_v0.R contains the Rcode for the discovery step. 

In addition, "simulated_dataset.csv" is available to run "rcode_v0.R" to demonstrate the CRE method. 

Both LASSO and Stability Selection are used to find causal rules from the simulated dataset.
